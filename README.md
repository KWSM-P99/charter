# Overview

## Why do we need structure?

The journey from a scattered idea to a successful implementation is riddled with challenges. Just as it's hard to herd cats, guiding a diverse team of passionate individuals towards building coherent and effective software can be even more daunting. A structured approach doesn't just bring order to chaos; it aligns our collective energy, ensuring that every member is rowing in the same direction and amplifying our potential.

## What is the goal of this charter?

At the heart of our endeavors is our community. Our aim is to consistently provide value by creating tools that aren’t just effective but are specially designed to cater to the unique needs and nuances of our community. By embracing the open-source ethos, we not only invite transparency but also encourage every community member to play an active role. Everyone should feel empowered to contribute, provide insights, and shape the tools that we build. Our ultimate objective? To collectively drive our community towards success.

## How we plan to achieve that goal?

Our strategy is rooted in organization and clarity. This repository is more than just a digital space; it's the backbone of our mission. By housing key resources, guidelines, and documents here, we ensure that every team member has access to a clear roadmap. It's not just about maintaining items; it's about fostering an environment where collaboration thrives. Here, every idea finds its footing, every challenge is addressed head-on, and our collective goals are translated into actionable tasks.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

### 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

- Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.

### 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

### 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible via our Discord server. 

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

### 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

### 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues, online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
