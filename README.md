##

### Why do we need structure?
Herding cats is hard. Mobilizing that herd to build software, harder.

### What is the goal of this charter?
Return value to our community by producing tools tailored to our communities unique needs.  Those tools are open-source and any member of the community should be able to contribute towards our overall success.

### How we plan to achieve that goal?
We will maintain key items in this repository that enable us to accomplish the goal of organization. 

Deliverables:
- Current goals and objectives approved by the steering commitee
- Key roles & responsibilities
- Contribution guidelines
- A process to onboard community members
- A process to review new project proposals
- A process to make changes to existing projects
- A list of current projects
- A schedule of monthly events where the team sync
- A record of event agenda items
